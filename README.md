# OnMouseDown responsiveness test

Inspired by this vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yaMGtiPckAQ&ab_channel=Theo-t3%E2%80%A4gg

## Does the onMouseDown event feel nicer than the onPress event?

I think so. It feels closer to how physical mice and keyboards work

## How to run

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`
